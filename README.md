Currently a work in progress, not ready for use

Factoro BP Ai is for generating factory blueprints, this is currently a work in progress and isn't working. The idea is that you will be asked to prompt the ai with something like "Generate a 2 to 1 belt balancer" or "Generate red circut factory, rate 500 per minute. inputs x1 copper belt (blue), x1 iron belt (blue), x1 plastic belt (blue), assembling machine 3, beacons (x1 speed module 3, x1 efficenfy moduel 3), roboports, tialable/not tialable."
